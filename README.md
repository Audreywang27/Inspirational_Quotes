This is a JFrame project made in VSCode. What it does it pull a random quote from a quote library I made and then display it! So basically, it's a random quote generator.
I made this project because I was interested in learning more about JFrames, I've mainly been experimenting with HTML, so I wanted to try something new! I also have a background in java from my school, so that also kinda motivated me to try JFrames out, because we haven't done that in class yet. 
Something I struggled the most with is probably all the different calls you can make with JFrame, like JLabel and JTextPane. There's so much variability...it took me a bit to figure out exactly what I needed to get my project to work correctly. But hey, at least I know a little more about using JFrames!
